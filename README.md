# Rock, Paper & Probabilities

Here is a software written in *python* to simulate the game **Rock, Paper & Probabilites**, a game we use to
introduce probability related concepts in mid-school classes. This tool may be useful to think about randomness
and how it affects the matches result.

You can play on your own [here](https://matedulab.gitlab.io/scripts/ppp.html?lan=eng).
